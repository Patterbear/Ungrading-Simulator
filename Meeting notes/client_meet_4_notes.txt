- Grade is based on skill level, nothing else. Ungrading not about completing activities. Confidence and activities are not a factor.
Activities increase confidence.
- Skill level + random factor is all that determines final grade.
- The grade you suggest is generated and given by the character - not the user.
- Awareness determines how close to final grade the character's suggested grade is.
- Need to be able to restart as a character.
- Confidence must changed to awareness.
