A project is defined as a sequence of tasks that must be completed to attain a certain outcome. 
According to the Project Management Institute (PMI), the term Project refers to ” to any temporary
endeavour with a definite beginning and end”. Depending on its complexity, it can be managed by a 
single person or hundreds.

Characteristics of a project:

1 - Temporary
There are projects that last several years but a project cannot go on forever. It needs to have a 
clear beginning, a definite end, and an overview of what happens in between

2 - Unique
Every project is unique, producing something that did not previously exist. A project is a one-time,
once-off activity, never to be repeated exactly the same way again

3 - Delivers results
It creates a product, service or result, often based on agreed requirements.

4 - not small
Requires non-trivial effort, often of more than one person
