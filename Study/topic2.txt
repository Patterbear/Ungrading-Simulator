Often, projects are divided into 4 project phases each of which comes with a distinct set 
of tasks, objectives, and a particular deadline. Dividing a project into different phases 
enables teams to stay on track throughout their entire life cycle.


1 - Initiation
The first phase in a project’s life cycle is called project initiation. Here, a project
officially launches. It is named, and a broad plan is defined. Goals are identified, along 
with the project’s constraints, risks, and shareholders. At this point, shareholders decide 
if they want to commit to the project.

2 - Planning
A roadmap that will guide teams from creating a project plan throughout the project’s 
execution and closure phases is developed comprehensively during the planning stage. 
Deadlines must be set, and resources must be allotted. Breaking down tasks into smaller, 
manageable activities makes it easier to manage project risks, costs, quality, time, and so 
on.

3 - Execution
The project plan is implemented during the project execution phase. At this point, teams 
will work on the deliverables to ensure that the project meets the necessary requirements.

4 - Closure
The final phase of the project management life cycle known as the project closure phase 
isn’t as simple as delivering the output itself. Project managers have to record all 
deliverables, organise documents in a centralised location, and hand over the project to the 
client.
