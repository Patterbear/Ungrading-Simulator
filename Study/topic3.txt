Every project operates within certain boundaries called constraints:

1 - Scope
e is what the project is trying to achieve, it entails all the work involved in delivering the 
project outcomes and the processes used to produce them; it is the reason and the purpose of the 
project.

2 - Time
Schedule is defined as the time to complete the project. Proper control of schedule requires the 
careful identification of tasks to be performed, an accurate estimation of their durations, the 
sequence in which they are going to be done, and how people and other resources are allocated

3 - Cost
The cost of the project, often dubbed the project’s budget, comprises all of the financial resources 
needed to complete the project on time, in its predetermined scope. Keep in mind that cost does not 
just mean money for materials — it encompasses costs for labor, vendors, quality control, and other 
factors, as well

4 - Quality
The quality constraint focuses on the characteristics of the deliverable or product. In general, the 
quality of the project will be evaluated by how closely the outcome matches the expectations set in 
the planning stages.  

All the constraints are equally important, if one of them is changed, it is likely the other 
constraints will have to be changed.
