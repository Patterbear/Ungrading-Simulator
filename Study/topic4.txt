Creating a project schedule:


1. Create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
2. Estimate the length of tasks in the WBS
3. Identify dependencies between tasks in the WBS
4. Create a Gantt Chart using this data


- A work breakdown Structure is a hierarchical decomposition of the work to be executed by a project
team, To identify all of the tasks required to complete a project


- We can't know how long a task will take. But we need some idea. So we estimate it. An Estimate is
a prediction of how long a task will take.


- There are four types of dependencies you can create:

	1 - Finish to start: Task B can't start before task A is finished.
	2 - Start to start: Task B can't start before task A starts.
	3 - Finish to finish: Task B can't finish before task A is finished.
	4 - Start to finish: Task A can't finish before Task B starts


- Create a Gantt Charts which is a visual illustration of the project schedule. Most commonly used 
software is known as GanttProject
