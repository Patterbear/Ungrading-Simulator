Allocating resources to tasks:

Resource Utilisation: 
How busy a resource is during a project. We aim to have all resources, including people, at 100% or 
less utilisation throughout the project.

How do we fix over-utilisation:
Re-scheduling - Moving/Delaying tasks or allocate the task to someone else who can do it



Project Costs:

There are 2 types of project costs, DIRECT and INDIRECT.

- On most project the biggest direct costs is employee salaries. Other direct costs are equipment and
materials required for the project.

- On most project the biggest Indirect costs is Utility costs(electricity, telephone, broadband,
water etc). Other indirect costs are Insurance and security cost.


The things used to complete a project including people and
materials are called "RESOURCES"
