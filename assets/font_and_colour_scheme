- The font for our program is assigned based on the system running the program
- It is stored in a global variable called 'gameFont'
- When creating buttons/labels/textboxes etc, add 'font=(gameFont, YOUR FONT SIZE)' to its arguments
- Font size will need to change based on the window, but do it in multiples of 5 to ensure consistency
- For message boxes, the font has already been set so don't worry
- Colour scheme for now is just the default grey, but this can be changed if the client wants
- The lab computers make the fonts look a little bit grainy but on normal machines it's fine
- For each new window you make use 'self.YOUR SCREEN NAME.iconphoto(False, tk.PhotoImage(file='app_icon.png'))' to assign the icon
